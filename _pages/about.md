### 💡 ABOUT ME
Hello, I am Jueon Kim ([dʒuːən kɪm], 김주언). I am an undergraduate student in **Biotechnology, Computer Science, and Bioinformatics** at [Sungkyunkwan University(SKKU)](https://www.skku.edu/eng). Additionally, I am currently pursuing a master's degree in [Computational biomedicine lab](https://hoonbiolab.github.io) through the combined BS-MS program, where I am advised by [Hoon Kim](https://hoonbiolab.github.io/people/prof.kim/). My research is focused on elucidating **the relationship between Glioblastoma and extrachromosomal DNA**.

I ultimately aspire to create a **world where elderly people can live freely**, much like in the village of The Hogeweyk in the Netherlands. Growing up in an area with a high percentage of seniors, I have a deep understanding of the challenges, isolation, and loneliness faced by older adults who lack financial resources and family support. This is why my final goal is to **run a healthcare company focused on serving the silver generation**.
