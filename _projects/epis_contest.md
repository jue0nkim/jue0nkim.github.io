I led a team of 4 composed of students studying biology and computer science.

Our team's project focuses on **imaging proteins**. Understanding the structure of proteins is crucial for the research on biosimilars, which are the main products of Samsung Bioepis. Therefore, we proposed **a advanced method for imaging non-crystalline suspended proteins** that addresses the limitations of existing techniques like X-ray crystallography, NMR, and Cryo-EM. We deployed **LAFM micrope** and **NeRF deep learning model**.

I gave an oral presentation on it's feasibility and applicability.

It was quite **challenging to prove** that the method we proposed is superior to existing imaging methods. We created **a table comparing the preprocessing steps, resolution, results, advantages, and disadvantages of each method**, and we finally convinced the audience.

We got the **second prize** out of **141 teams**. That's incredible! ðŸ‘€
