I led a team of 4 to predict the presence of Alzheimer’s disease with mRNA biomarker.

We achieved **an AUC of 0.96 and 92% accuracy**, surpassing the performance of models from previous studies using the same dataset.

This result is obtained by architecting **a random forest algorithm to extract the top 20 mRNA candidates** based on feature attribution and developing **an MLP classifier**.

I gave an **oral presentation** and we had a Q&A session afterward.

Despite the model's performance, we received some **criticism**. I believe this was primarily because we **did not clearly establish the correlation between degree of Alzheimer's disease progression and mRNA expression levels** during the initial stages of our research.

We got **second prize** out of **7 teams**.

The important thing is not the ranking, but **the experience of taking action on something I have only thought about vaguely until now**, which will serve as the starting point for the many challenges I will face in the future.
