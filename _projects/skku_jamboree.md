I gave an **oral presentation** and we had a Q&A session afterward.

Despite the model's performance, we received some **criticism**. I believe this was primarily because we **did not clearly establish the correlation between degree of Alzheimer's disease progression and mRNA expression levels** during the initial stages of our research.

We got second prize out of 7 teams.

The important thing is not the ranking, but **the experience of taking action on something I have only thought about vaguely until now**, which will serve as the starting point for the many challenges I will face in the future.
