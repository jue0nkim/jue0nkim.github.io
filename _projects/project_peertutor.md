I am currently serving as a peer tutor for genetics this semester.

Genetics is a crucial discipline that forms the foundation for all areas of biology. I want my tutees to grasp the overall concepts of biology, rather than just memorizing for exams.

We meet weekly at the same time for our study sessions. The tutees present the sections they have prepared, and I provide additional explanations on any points they may have missed. Occasionally, I find myself learning from my tutees as well. 


Sharing knowledge and helping each other is truly a valuable experience.
