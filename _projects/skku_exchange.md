I took a total of six courses, three of which were major subjects. Although they were relatively basic for me, they served as a valuable review of what I had learned in the past. Being familiar with the content allowed me to notice **the differences between the higher education systems in Korea and the US.**

I genuinely appreciate my new friends for sharing a small part of their lives with me. It was my first time out of Asia and living abroad. I initially struggled due to the language barrier and cultural differences. However, I really fit in by the end, thanks to all of their kindness.
