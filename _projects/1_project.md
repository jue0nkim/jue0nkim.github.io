I led a team of 4, which composed of students of biology, computer science.


I gave verbal presentation on feasibility and applicability

    </div>
</div>

We identified limitations of existing methods used for imaging antibodies.
Also, we plan strategy by deploying LAFM and NeRF deep learning model

        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/episcontest_prize.jpg" title="bioepis_contest_prize" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

Fianlly, we got the second prize out of 141 teams. That's incredible!
